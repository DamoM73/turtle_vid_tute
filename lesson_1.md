### What's an IDE

Welcome to our first lesson on Python Turtle. In this lesson you will be introduced to Thonny - the integrated development environment (IDE) we will use to write our code. We are going to have a look at a really basic python code and understand some of its syntax.

> We will be using Thonny as our IDE. Thonny is a Python IDE for beginners. It comes packages with Python, which helps with the setup. You can download it from: **[thonny.org/](https://thonny.org/)**.

It's important to understand that Thonny isn't the language we will be programming with, Python. Just like you use Microsoft Word to write English, we will be using Thonny to write Python. 

Python is programmed in text files called scripts. You can use any text editor to program Python. Integrated development environment like Thonny have additional features like highlighting syntax by marking it in different colours and helping you debug your program. We will deal with those features later, in the meanwhile just think of Thonny as a text editor with extra features built in.

### The User Interface

Your the user interface you'll not look
slightly different we'll change around
to work on that but to start off with
you can see over here this is where we
actually type our code in this little
space here this is the code editor here
and this is the particular script we
have open at the moment which is just an
untitled unsaved um file which is here
that we haven't used
down the bottom we have the terminal um
or the shell so this is where your text
out by um output will be going um
down the bottom here over here is the
assistant now yours may be turned off or
may not be turned on
so to um view your assistant is to you
can turn it on and off with the view
here
and you can see with the assistant there
is
what it will do will help you with your
actual coding because tony is designed
primarily for education purposes
says to help you learn how to use python
um
also the way that my python my funny
looks might be slightly different like
when i type my first line in here
you can see that it is
red if you type yours in you'll probably
won't be red it'll be a different color
because i've changed my theme
um or my text theme so to do that you
just go to tools and you go options and
then you say your um
theme and font
and then choose ideally classic which
makes it look the same as mine so you
can see all the highlighting that i got
in here which has different meanings for
different words it will help you follow
what i'm actually doing on my computer
so it lines up color wise 

### First Program

so let's go
and start our first program which is
here and it says our first program
so
what we're going to do is going to make
a really simple little program
called
print
hello world
because this is
the traditional way that
we kind of write your very first program
now let's remember the concept of prim
that we are using so when we're talking
about actually using um code the idea is
before we actually run the code is we
try to predict um as we without running
the code have a guess at what we think
the actual code is going to do when
they're going to run it and then see
whether our prediction is correct and
we'll do that in every single time we go
through some code
investigating we're going to take a
closer look and see if we change things
what happens we change values around or
change characters around and we'll
actually do that you can modify your
code so it does something different and
then finally you can apply your
knowledge that you developed from that
code to make something different
so
what are we doing here print hello world
i'm going to run it and it's going to
ask me to save it now i've made a
folder called python channel on my
desktop that your folder python turtle
should be
in your year 7 digital Technologies folder
so here we come down and in my python
turtle folder i'm going to give this a
name and this is my lesson one
um
cute
one
yeah shoot one and now i could not put
dot py at the end which would tell us
that this is a python script but thoni
will automatically add that at the end
to let it know that this is a python
script so i'm going to click on that and
it's going to run and then down the
bottom it's actually so actually what
you predicted was actually happened that
you think that it was going to say hello
world down there um
and interesting it says hello world
that's a couple of things to observe
let's see first off it doesn't
it doesn't do anything with this
okay there's no kind of effect there you
know i can actually
change this around and i run it again
and it makes no difference
okay now why is that well up here you
see this little
hash at the beginning this tells um
python that this is a comment i it is
designed for humans it is designed to
explain things to humans to make notes
to people um we will be using that
extensively throughout our programming
here on how we actually
put information into our code which
which the computer ignores so that's our
little first little thing is a little
hashtag that gives us comments 

### Simple Troubleshooting

now down
here what have we got here
we've got purple which is a command word
print it says print it basically says
send it to terminal whatever's in these
brackets here so if i remove that if i
said um pin or print
or print
you'll see that okay wait a second that
isn't purple so it gives me here that
it's not right and if i try to run it
it's going to come up with an error see
traceback error
tell me what line it's in it's in this
file
which is my
chute um lesson one shoot one
radio line three in module so line three
is one two three it's this line here and
it says name p-r-i-t is not defined so
it doesn't know what that is so that's
cool so i know the problem is this i'm
gonna change
that and go in
and let's run it again
okay it was happy so let's see what else
can i change in this investigation here
what happens if i get rid of
um let's see let's get rid of
these
what does that do get rid of the the
quotation marks so print hello world i
wanted to do this say hello world and
run
and it comes up with an error
um look at this invalid syntax
perhaps you forgot a comma and you'll
learn that why it says it later on but
look at this it actually points where
all the errors are error is along here
along this part here
so i'm going to put those
inverted commas back
and
see how this is green this tells it that
this is a string or a list of characters
so things inside vertical in inverted
commas and they can be double inverted
commas or they can be single inverted
commas things inside of miracom is
basically saying this is just a whole
bunch of of characters it's words it's
sentences there can be even numbers in
there but it says just just
put up this up as
the way it is print this out the way it
is and that's called a string so what
about if i get rid of one of these
brackets or get rid of both those
brackets do they need to be there
let's just try that
yeah many missing parentheses to call
print did you mean to say print cool
tells us that
rightio so
let's see what's the last thing actually
look at this if i have an open bracket
there so if i get rid of the close
bracket and i run it again it tells me
oh
error there the opening bracket this
opening bracket was never closed and
also finally gives you that hint there
because it says look this gray bar says
you have a bracket that you haven't
closed
it does the same with the inverted
commas
it says you have an inverted comma
anything you type afterwards if you
haven't closed it it's going to be in
that green highlight
righty-o so there we are that is our
basic
um
code here
let's have a look at the side of here
the assistant basically says the code
looks good and if there were some
problems if it was a bit a bit off the
assistant would give you some hints of
how to fix it up

### First exercise

so what i wanted to do is i want you
just to now make yourself a really quick
just adjust it a couple of times and
make it say different things
and then i will see you in our next
tutorial
