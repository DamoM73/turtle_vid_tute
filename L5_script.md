# Lesson 5

## Tutorial 1: Conditionals

Starting with code from L4_Ex4.py

```python
max_num = int(input("Enter nubmer to count to: "))

for num in range(max_num):
    print(num + 1)
```

What happens when we enter a letter?

`ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'g'`

We need a way to check whether the input is a number or a letter.

`.isdigit()`
